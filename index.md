# Xingjian Bai (白行健)

<img src="https://xingjianbai.com/xingjian.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

<!-- I am a senior undergrad majoring in **EECS** at Fuzhou University and Maynooth University (Combined degrees). Currently, I serve as a research assistant at the IIoT-Lab, advised by [Prof. Zhezhuang Xu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhezhuang-Xu) and [Dr. Meng Yuan](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Meng-Yuan-4). I also spent a lovely summer research program with [Prof. Pietro Liò's team](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/) at Cambridge University. Recently, I have been selected as an **AAAI UC Scholar**. I will be attending AAAI-24 in person, please feel free to chat with me! -->
I am a final-year undergraduate student at Oxford, where my research has focused on [learning-augmented algorithm](https://algorithms-with-predictions.github.io/) and theory-inspired machine learning models.
I am fascinated by the elegant theories underlying classic algorithms, and the potential of enhancing the reasoning abilities and theoretical soundness of current machine learning models.
The fundamental motivation behind my work is to develop automated decision-making systems with human-level cognitive abilities, so they can be used to advance our understanding of intelligence and contribute to the development of other sciences.

During my time at Oxford, I have had the privilege of working with Prof. [Jan Obloj](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/jan.obloj), Prof. [Christian Coester](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/christian.coester/), Prof. [Christian Rupprecht](https://chrirupp.github.io/), and [Luke Melas-Kyriazi](https://lukemelas.github.io/). Additionally, I have spent an enriching summer at Stanford, working with Prof. [Jiajun Wu](https://jiajunwu.com/), Dr. [Weiyu Liu](http://weiyuliu.com/), and [Joy Hsu](https://web.stanford.edu/~joycj/).
